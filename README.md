1. Do the following before installing the dependencies found in `requirements.txt` file because of current challenges installing `onnxruntime` through `pip install onnxruntime`. 

    - For MacOS users, a workaround is to first install `onnxruntime` dependency for `chromadb` using:

    ```python
     conda install onnxruntime -c conda-forge
    ```
    See this [thread](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/11037) for additonal help if needed. 

     - For Windows users, follow the guide [here](https://github.com/bycloudai/InstallVSBuildToolsWindows?tab=readme-ov-file) to install the Microsoft C++ Build Tools. Be sure to follow through to the last step to set the enviroment variable path.


2. Now run this command to install dependenies in the `requirements.txt` file. 

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install markdown depenendies with: 

```python
pip install "unstructured[md]"
```

## Create database

Create the Chroma DB.

```python
python create_database.py
```

## Query the database

Query the Chroma DB.

```python
python query_data.py "How does Alice meet the Mad Hatter?"
```

> You'll also need to set up an OpenAI account (and set the OpenAI key in your environment variable) for this to work.
